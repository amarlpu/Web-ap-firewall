Our project can do couple of useful stuff to your server.
Our WAF (Web Application Firewall) runs in the background and protects your server
from web attacks and hackers. In addition, our tool can scan your network and see if its safe.
More than that, every 24 hours our WAF will send to your email a log containing information about all
the attacks it blocked. You have the option to see the current Emails the WAF will send to them
the log, or even add Email or remove Email from the list.
